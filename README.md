# ⚡ ️Tigris example app on Next.js - Real-time Search

This application is built with Next.js and Tigris and provides a full-stack solution. Products are stored and retrieved from a Tigris database to be displayed to customers. To improve accessibility, I integrated a real-time search feature, allowing users to quickly search for their desired products.

<summary> 🪢 Tigris schema definition</summary>

[db/models/store.ts](db/models/store.ts) - The app has a single collection
`products` that stores the products in the store. This Collection gets automatically created/updated by the
[setup script](scripts/setup.ts). 
</details>

<details>
<summary> ❇️ API routes to access data in Tigris collection</summary>

All the Next.js API routes are defined under `pages/api/`. We have three files exposing endpoints: 

#### [`pages/api/store/index.ts`](pages/api/store/index.ts)

- `GET /api/store` to get an array of products as Array<Products>
- `GET /api/items/search?q=query` to find and return products matching the given query
